# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression problems can be solved using exponential cone constraints. An example on how to use COSMO to solve a logistic regression problem is presented in [/examples/logistic\_regression\_regularization.ipynb](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/COSMO.jl/tree/master/examples/logistic_regression_regularization.ipynb).
